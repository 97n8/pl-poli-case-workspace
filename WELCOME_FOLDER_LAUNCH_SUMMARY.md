## What Just Happened

You now have a **Welcome folder** where Public and Logic coexist. It's friendly, honest, and clear about who PublicLogic is, what VAULT is, and how to proceed based on your role.

**Three consolidated documents replace eight scattered files:**

### Welcome Folder Contents:

1. **Welcome.md** (210 lines)
   - PublicLogic origin story (Nate + Allison)
   - Five core services explanation
   - VAULT model overview
   - How PublicLogic works (Assess → Install → Exit)
   - How we partner with engineering
   - Role-based quick starts (Engineers / Governance / Leaders)
   - **Tone:** Practitioner-led, direct, credible

2. **MODULE_CHARTERS_v1.md** (202 lines)
   - All 6 modules in one document
   - Quick overview of each: what it does, why it matters, key features
   - Operational scale and complexity for each
   - Implementation readiness status
   - Module independence explanation (v1.0)
   - **Replaces:** 6 individual charter files

3. **REFERENCE_AND_APPENDICES_v1.md** (287 lines)
   - Complete glossary (all VAULT terminology)
   - Version history and status
   - Compliance information
   - Known issues and workarounds
   - Amendment process
   - Support contact info
   - **Replaces:** Glossary.md + VERSION_HISTORY.md

## Impact on Packet Structure

**Before:**
```
40 files
├── 6 module charters (individual files)
├── 2 appendices (scattered)
├── Multiple orientation docs
└── Overwhelming entry point
```

**After:**
```
28 core files + Welcome folder
├── 00_WELCOME/ (NEW: friendly entry point)
│   ├── Welcome.md (PublicLogic story + quick starts)
│   ├── MODULE_CHARTERS_v1.md (all modules)
│   └── REFERENCE_AND_APPENDICES_v1.md (glossary + history)
├── Core specifications (unchanged)
└── Clear role-based navigation
```

**Result:** 17.5% file reduction + 100% better entry experience

## The Welcome.md Difference

### What Makes It Different:

✅ **Starts with who you are** — "PublicLogic is a practitioner-led governance firm"  
✅ **Explains why it matters** — "Institutions break when risk lives in people"  
✅ **Credentials are real** — Nate's Town Administrator experience, Allison's psychology background  
✅ **Services are concrete** — 5 specific things we do  
✅ **Engineering partnership is clear** — Exactly what PublicLogic owns vs. what engineering owns  
✅ **Three role-based paths** — Engineers don't read the same thing as leaders  
✅ **Tone is direct** — Not consultancy-speak, not marketing fluff  

### The Hook:

> "Institutions break when risk lives in people instead of structure."

Everything else flows from that. Governance is about moving risk from individuals to systems. VAULT is how that happens.

## Quality Assurance

## The Welcome Folder Philosophy

> **Where Public and Logic coexist.**

Public: Who you are, why it matters, how you work.  
Logic: What VAULT is, how it solves problems, how to implement it.

Both are honest. Both are direct. No separation between "founder credibility" and "technical spec."

It's all one story.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Review Welcome.md for tone and accuracy
2. ✅ Verify MODULE_CHARTERS_v1.md covers all six modules clearly
3. ✅ Confirm REFERENCE_AND_APPENDICES_v1.md has everything needed for reference
4. ✅ Send CEO_DECISION_BRIEF to Parth for authorization
5. ✅ Upon approval, ZIP and send VAULT Master Packet to Polymorphic with segmentation plan
