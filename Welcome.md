## Governance Design for Institutions Under Pressure

---

## You're Opening VAULT

This is the **VAULT Master Engineering Packet v1.0** — the complete specification for how durable municipal governance systems work.

But first: who we are, and why this matters.

---

## PublicLogic: Who We Are

**PublicLogic** is a practitioner-led governance and institutional design firm. We work with municipalities and regulated organizations where legality, continuity, and public trust are non-negotiable.

We exist to solve a specific failure mode:

> **Institutions break when risk lives in people instead of structure.**

Our work moves institutional risk out of individual staff, inboxes, and memory into **explicit authority, durable records, enforceable rules, and transfer-ready systems**.

We are not a consultancy in the traditional sense. We design and install governance structure that is intended to hold under audit, turnover, and political pressure. When people leave, the system remains intact.

### The Founders

**Nathan R. Boudreau** — Founder, PublicLogic

Nathan is a former Massachusetts Town Administrator with more than a decade of direct executive responsibility for public records, finance, HR, licensing, procurement, compliance, and board governance. PublicLogic was built from lived experience operating inside active Town Hall environments. The methods here reflect what actually fails under pressure and what reliably holds when staff leave, audits arrive, or conditions change.

**Allison Weiss Rothschild** — Co-Founder, PublicLogic

Allison is an organizational psychologist and behavioral systems specialist. Her work focuses on how institutions behave under cognitive load, uncertainty, and sustained stress. At PublicLogic, behavioral insight is applied as a **design constraint**, not a narrative. Systems are shaped so they do not require vigilance, heroics, or personal sacrifice to function safely.

## What PublicLogic Does

PublicLogic provides **governance design and installation**, not software and not change management.

### Five Core Services:

**1. Authority Design**  
We explicitly document who can decide, approve, escalate, or override, and under what conditions. This removes informal decision-making and aligns real authority with formal responsibility.

**2. Records Governance**  
We define what must be recorded, retained, versioned, locked, disclosed, or destroyed. Records become institutional memory, not personal artifacts.

**3. Workflow Containment**  
We design how work is allowed to enter, move, pause, escalate, and close. Work is bounded, sequenced, and terminable.

**4. Risk Relocation**  
We identify where legal, operational, and reputational risk exists and ensure it is carried structurally, not absorbed personally by staff.

**5. Continuity and Transfer**  
We ensure work survives turnover. Knowledge, authority, and compliance pathways do not live in individuals.

**Deliverables:** Diagrams, rulesets, record classes, thresholds, escalation paths, and closure conditions. Concrete. Implementation-ready.

## The VAULT Model

PublicLogic operates through a governance architecture called **VAULT**.

**VAULT is not software. It is not methodology.** It is an **institutional operating contract** that defines the minimum conditions under which work may safely exist inside an organization.

VAULT resolves five non-negotiable domains:

* **Authority** — decision rights and escalation logic
* **Record** — institutional memory and audit trail
* **Flow** — intake, sequencing, deadlines, and closure
* **Risk** — compliance and liability containment
* **Transfer** — survivability through turnover

VAULT is intentionally system-agnostic. It is designed to be encoded into platforms, not replaced by them.

---

## How PublicLogic Works

PublicLogic engagements are finite and disciplined:

**1. Assess** — Identify where governance currently lives in people instead of structure.

**2. Install** — Deliver governance artifacts designed to be directly implemented by internal teams or technology partners.

**3. Exit** — Ownership transfers fully to the institution. No permanent dependency. The objective is durable self-sufficiency.

---

## How We Partner with Engineering

**PublicLogic defines the institutional substrate.**  
**Engineering teams implement the runtime.**

**We own:**
- Valid units of work (CASE model)
- Authority boundaries (who decides)
- Record obligations (what must be kept)
- Escalation thresholds (when to escalate)
- Closure conditions (when work is done)

**You own:**
- State machines (implementation)
- Data models (database design)
- Interfaces (UI/UX)
- Automation (timing, batch processing)
- Integrations (external systems)

**The boundary is explicit and enforced.** Governance is not retrofitted after systems are live.

---

## Why This Matters

PublicLogic exists to make institutions survivable.

When authority is explicit, records are durable, workflows are bounded, and risk is owned structurally, systems become easier to build and safer to operate.

This is governance designed the way engineers design systems: **explicit, constrained, testable, and built to outlast the people who created it.**

## Now: Where Do You Go?

If you're reading this, one of three things is true:

1. **You're an engineer** building VAULT into a platform
2. **You're governance/legal** evaluating this approach
3. **You're a leader** deciding if this is the right direction

All paths lead to the same insight: a system that works when people leave.

## Quick Start for Engineers

You're building VAULT into a runtime system.

**Read in this order (total: 2-3 hours):**

1. This file (you're reading it)
2. `Read_First.md` — what this packet is
3. `01_VAULT_CORE_CANON/CASE_Workspace.md` — the root entity (critical)
4. `01_VAULT_CORE_CANON/Authority_and_Scope.md` — why this matters
5. All of `01_VAULT_CORE_CANON/` (master the foundations)
6. `02_MODULES/PRR/` — reference implementation (how it all works)
7. `03_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE/What_Engineers_May_Choose.md` and `What_Is_Non_Negotiable.md`

**Then:** Pick a module. Follow the pattern from PRR. Build it.

**If you hit ambiguity:** Escalate via governance gap protocol (see `Escalation_SLA.md`). We respond in 4-24 hours.

---

## Quick Start for Governance / Legal

You're evaluating this approach or validating statutory interpretation.

**Read in this order (total: 90 minutes):**

1. This file
2. `00_README/Audience_and_Use.md` — what this is for
3. `01_VAULT_CORE_CANON/Authority_and_Scope.md` — why it exists
4. `01_VAULT_CORE_CANON/Timer_and_Deadline_Model.md` — how enforcement works (critical for compliance)
5. Module charters (consolidated in `MODULE_CHARTERS_v1.md`)
6. `REFERENCE_AND_APPENDICES_v1.md` — reference glossary and version history

**Then:** Review specific modules relevant to your domain (licensing, records, finance, etc.)

**Questions?** Email info@publiclogic.com. We turn around governance questions in 24 hours.

---

## Quick Start for Leaders

You're deciding if this is the direction for your institution.

**Read (total: 15 minutes):**

1. This file (you're reading it)
2. `00_README/What_Is_Out_of_Scope.md` — what this is NOT
3. `CEO_DECISION_BRIEF_v1.md` (in the root) — what we're asking you to authorize

**That's it.** Everything else is implementation detail.

**Key insight:** This moves risk from people to structure. When authority is explicit, records are durable, and workflows are bounded, your institution survives turnover, audit, and pressure.

**Next step:** Authorize Wave 1 to engineering. Support PRR pilot in 1-2 towns. Validate approach. Expand from there.

## One Sentence

> This packet defines VAULT Core once, then expresses each module as a governed specialization. You are implementing one system, not five products. And it's designed to survive you leaving.
